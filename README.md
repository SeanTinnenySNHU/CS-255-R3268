CS-255 Portfolio 


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  The client of the Driverpass project is a company named Driverpass. Driverpass is looking for a system to allow people who are learning how to drive the tools to study for behind the wheel     and written driving tests. 

What did you do particularly well?

  In this project I feel as though I broke down use cases into models very well. I ended up breaking down the login and reset password portions of the system.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  One area I would chose to revise in my documents is the requirements portion of the Business requirements document. I would improve upon this by going into more detail about each requirement   and why I chose that requirement. I believe that revising this would give a better outlook on why I chose some of these requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  To incorperate user needs into my design of the system I decided to add user specific quality of life features to the system. One of these quality of life features being the reset password     function being open to all users rather than the server admin. It is important to consider uesr needs while designing a system to ensure that the system is usable and the expected result for   the system is reached.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  When beginning a design of software I like to look over the expected result of the system I am about to design. This allows me to begin designing with the knowledge of what I am working        towards building. A new technique that I am going to adopt is using models to plan out features in the system.
